# algorithms-datastructures

I made this simple website as a fun project to help me understand better: algorithms and data structures. And also to have some practice in: Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and responsive web design(RWD). If you discover some errors in the code or typos I haven't noticed please just let me know or feel free to contribute with Github, fork the project and make a pull request :)

Sections are divided into:

  - Big o cheat sheets
  - intro
  - big o notation
  - data structures
  - algorithms

### Tech
This website uses the following technologies to work properly:

* JS & jQuery for interactivity 
* CSS + HTML for structure and styling
* Git for VCS

### Todo's

 - Check responsiveness in other devices; adjust accordingly when needed
